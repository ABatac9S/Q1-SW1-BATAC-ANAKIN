	<h1 style="color:mediumpurple;"> Why people play gacha games </h1>

	<p> Games with a long grind to it doesn't seem very appealing at first but typically that gets people interested is the story of the game and its characters. <br/> Even though it may take weeks to even months to save up for the character on the banner you like people will still grind because of the impact that it had on them to the design or their backstory. </p>
